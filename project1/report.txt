Assignment:     Project 1

I have successfully completed the project through part 4 but have not attempted the extra credit. I got a few zombie processes when I ran my workfile but I think it is because the commands are running faster than my /proc folder read.

I have attached all 4 versions but there are memory leaks in previous versions ( v1, v2, v3 ).
